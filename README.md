# 🎗 Breast Cancer Classifier - README

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project aims to analyze and classify breast cancer data using exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning. The workflow is divided into two phases:
1️⃣ **Phase 1:** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
2️⃣ **Phase 2:** Breast Cancer Classification Model

## 📂 Notebooks
### 1️⃣ Phase 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
📌 **File:** `Phase 1 EDA.ipynb`
- Loads and preprocesses the dataset.
- Performs initial data exploration (e.g., checking missing values, feature distributions).
- Visualizes important patterns and correlations in the dataset.
- Provides insights to guide feature selection for model building.

### 2️⃣ Phase 2: Breast Cancer Classifier
📌 **File:** `Phase 2 Breast_Cancer_Classifier.ipynb`
- Prepares the dataset for model training.
- Implements machine learning models for classification.
- Evaluates model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Fine-tunes the model for better performance.

## 📊 Dataset
- The dataset used in this project contains features related to breast cancer diagnosis.
- It includes various numerical attributes extracted from medical images.
- Labels indicate whether a tumor is **malignant** 🚨 or **benign** ✅.

## ⚙️ Installation & Requirements
To run these notebooks, you need the following dependencies:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow
```
🛠️ Ensure you have **Jupyter Notebook** installed or use **Google Colab** for execution.

## ▶️ How to Run
1️⃣ Open `Phase 1 EDA.ipynb` and run all cells to explore the dataset. 🔍
2️⃣ Open `Phase 2 Breast_Cancer_Classifier.ipynb` to train and evaluate the model. 🤖

## 📈 Results & Findings
- The EDA provided insights into the most significant features affecting classification.
- The classifier achieved high accuracy in distinguishing between malignant and benign tumors.
- Feature selection and hyperparameter tuning improved performance.

## 🌟 Future Improvements
- Experimenting with deep learning models (e.g., CNNs) for improved accuracy.
- Enhancing feature engineering techniques.
- Deploying the model as a web app for real-world usability.
