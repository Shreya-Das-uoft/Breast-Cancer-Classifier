# 🎗️ Breast Cancer Classifier - README

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project aims to analyze and classify breast cancer data using exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning. The workflow is divided into two phases:
1️⃣ **Phase 1:** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 🧐
2️⃣ **Phase 2:** Breast Cancer Classification Model 🤖

## 📂 Notebooks
### 1️⃣ Phase 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
📌 **File:** `Phase 1 EDA.ipynb`
- 📊 Loads and preprocesses the dataset.
- 🔍 Performs initial data exploration (e.g., checking missing values, feature distributions).
- 📈 Visualizes important patterns and correlations in the dataset.
- 🛠️ Provides insights to guide feature selection for model building.

### 2️⃣ Phase 2: Breast Cancer Classifier
📌 **File:** `Phase 2 Breast_Cancer_Classifier.ipynb`
- 🏗️ Prepares the dataset for model training.
- 🤖 Implements machine learning models for classification.
- 📊 Evaluates model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- 🎯 Fine-tunes the model for better performance.

## 📊 Dataset
- 📂 The dataset used in this project contains features related to breast cancer diagnosis.
- 🏥 It includes various numerical attributes extracted from medical images.
- 🏷️ Labels indicate whether a tumor is **malignant** 🚨 or **benign** ✅.

## ⚙️ Installation & Requirements
To run these notebooks, you need the following dependencies:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow
```
🛠️ Ensure you have **Jupyter Notebook** installed or use **Google Colab** for execution.

## ▶️ How to Run
1️⃣ Open `Phase 1 EDA.ipynb` and run all cells to explore the dataset. 🔍
2️⃣ Open `Phase 2 Breast_Cancer_Classifier.ipynb` to train and evaluate the model. 🤖

## 📈 Results & Findings
- 🔬 The EDA provided insights into the most significant features affecting classification.
- 🎯 The classifier achieved high accuracy in distinguishing between malignant and benign tumors.
- 🔧 Feature selection and hyperparameter tuning improved performance.

## 🌟 Future Improvements
- 🧠 Experimenting with deep learning models (e.g., CNNs) for improved accuracy.
- 🔍 Enhancing feature engineering techniques.
- 🌐 Deploying the model as a web app for real-world usability.
